# Core Concepts & Foundational Questions
- Creativity to evolution and transcendence (as a catalyst of emergence) // Addressed in appendix_culture_creativity.md
- Free energy principle // Addressed in appendix_free_energy.md

# Philosophical Considerations
- Idealism unfulfilled // Philosophical point, relates to limits of current emergent layers?
- Will the universe be just a mathematical illusion given many field-based coherences? // Philosophical point, relates to Chapter 2.6
    - But there’s no mathematical expression possible because it’s either unsolvable or unreducible

# Socio-Cultural, Economic & Political Aspects
- Capitalism and economics // Addressed in appendix_economics.md
- Why totalitarianism is so popular but always fails? // Discussed in appendix_politics.md (re: costs, fragility, emergence potential)
- How Sharim boosted information falsification, expanded space of information flow; like GPU to expand computing // Specific concept - relation to information entropy/tech layer?
- Zero didn't exist until very late in human history
    - Numberiosity doesnt seem to be a natural human instinct as well
    - "Have you thought that 0 is same as a story of others? Something from nothing?"
- Many concepts are introduced to us by language // Relates to Cultural Layer (Ch 7) and appendix_culture_creativity.md
    - Language is a tool for communication, not a tool for thinking
    - And language has strong indication of thinking
    - Many concept becomes pump because we have them already in society, it's not a natural instinct
- Loud propagandas like DeepSeek, NeZha, Manos AI, TikTok, etc.
    - Why some of them are so successful? while others not? // Can be analyzed via Emergence Potential (P = R * delta_H) - high reusability/scalability (R) and significant entropy reduction (utility, engagement). Relates to economics, culture, tech layers.
- values are different price, while noise is different from signals
- the problem of captialism at AI age // Extension of appendix_economics.md
- sharism vs capitalism // Specific economic/social model comparison
    - fish and sentimental bank run // Specific example/concept related to sharism/capitalism?

# Technical / Implementation Details
- PPPE/HERE protocol and experiments // Specific project/implementation plan
    - Share model
    - Payments
    - MVP
    - Distribution

# Project Management / Next Steps
- Re-check the research paper and form a better quest thread → narrative
- ACI branding
- Rewrite the whole concept (AC+AI+Experience)

# Meta / Research Process Notes
- the exploration of Recursive Emergence itself is a result of Recursive Emergence // Meta-point, potentially for introduction or conclusion
