What Should Google Do? 

Eighteen years ago, as a young technologist, I wrote an open letter to Google’s founders, Larry and Sergey, which was received and enacted. That vision helped shape Google’s integrity and momentum for nearly two decades.


Today, Google stands at a crossroads. ChatGPT-style tools are fundamentally transforming how people access, process, and internalize knowledge. Traditional search is no longer sufficient. Users now expect synthesis, simulation, and contextual reasoning. Google’s dominance in indexing is being challenged by systems that model understanding and simulate meaning, not just retrieve facts.


What should Google do next? Should it follow competitors into the race of ever-larger, brute-force language models prone to hallucinations? Or should it embrace its unique strengths and lead the next evolution of knowledge systems?


To realize this vision, Google must do more than advance its own research—it should strategically integrate both external and internal innovations. Acquiring or partnering with organizations like Anthropic (Claude) could accelerate technical progress and diversify its AI toolsets, especially as LLMs become increasingly homogenized. At the same time, Google should unify its internal assets—DeepMind, LLMNotes, Google Translate, and its voice and vision processing technologies—under a single cognitive umbrella. This fusion would create a robust, adaptive, and ethically guided intelligence platform, capable of synthesizing knowledge across modalities and domains. By integrating these strengths, Google can uniquely lead the next era of cognitive infrastructure, driving collaboration, innovation, and responsible progress on a global scale.


More critically, beyond LLMs, the true frontier is recursive intelligence—not just better answers, but systems that can build structured memory (Ψ), generate coherent insight (Φ), and resolve contradictions through dynamic feedback (Ω). Google must evolve from an information retrieval engine into the world’s recursive cognitive infrastructure, enabling emergence: the crystallization of new, higher-order understanding from complexity.


But Google still possesses the infrastructure, reach, and ethical responsibility to lead this transformation—if it acts before it’s too late. The platform that indexed the web can now index, align, and elevate civilization’s collective intelligence. By fostering recursive thinking and emergent insight, Google can help humanity navigate the accelerating complexity of our era.



Now, with the benefit of experience, I want to be clear: my hope is not rooted in brand loyalty. I value healthy competition and the innovation it brings. Yet, in a landscape clouded by myths and hypes, I place my hopes in Google’s unique capacity to lead responsibly—rising to this challenge, making the right choices, and helping to safeguard humanity’s future at this pivotal moment.
