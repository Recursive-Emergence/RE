When you are reading this book(whatever format it is), you are assuming that you are reading my mind, not the book's mind because we would not think mind has a mind of its own. 

But the book is not just a collection of words not my mind now; it is a reflection of my thoughts, ideas, and experiences. It is a journey through the layers of being, exploring the intricate relationship between consciousness, entropy, and the evolution of intelligence.

This book is a culmination of years of research, writing, and reflection. It is a labor of love, crafted with care and attention to detail. I have poured my heart and soul into these pages, hoping to share my insights and provoke thought in others.

I've open-sourced this book for free access, allowing it to exist in multiple formats. You might be reading it online, as a paper book republished by a publisher, as an ebook, or even in a format you've personally converted for your preferred reading device. 

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
