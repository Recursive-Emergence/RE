# Historical Philosophies of Consciousness

## Dualism (Ren√© Descartes, 17th century)
- **Core Thesis**: Mind and body are fundamentally different substances; consciousness is non-physical and separate from the material brain
- **Key Concept**: The "Cogito ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am") establishes the mind as the primary certainty
- **Implications**: Suggests potential independence of consciousness from physical processes; raises the mind-body interaction problem

## Materialism (Thomas Hobbes, La Mettrie, 17th-18th centuries)
- **Core Thesis**: Consciousness is entirely physical, produced by material processes in the brain
- **Key Concept**: Mental phenomena are identical to brain states or produced by them
- **Implications**: Consciousness could potentially be replicated in artificial systems with the right physical structure

## Idealism (George Berkeley, 18th century)
- **Core Thesis**: Only minds and mental contents exist; material objects are collections of ideas
- **Key Concept**: "To be is to be perceived" (esse est percipi)
- **Implications**: Consciousness is primary; physical reality is dependent on mind, not vice versa

## Phenomenology (Edmund Husserl, 20th century)
- **Core Thesis**: Philosophy must study conscious experience as experienced from the first-person point of view
- **Key Concept**: "Bracketing" assumptions about the external world to focus on pure experience
- **Implications**: Consciousness has an inherent structure that can be rigorously analyzed

## Behaviorism (B.F. Skinner, mid-20th century)
- **Core Thesis**: Consciousness should be understood only through observable behavior, not internal states
- **Key Concept**: Mental terms can be translated into statements about behavioral dispositions
- **Implications**: Skepticism about the scientific value of first-person reports of conscious experience

## Functionalism (Hilary Putnam, late 20th century)
- **Core Thesis**: Mental states are defined by their functional/causal roles, not by their physical composition
- **Key Concept**: Multiple realizability - consciousness could exist in various physical substrates
- **Implications**: Supports the possibility of artificial consciousness if functional organization is replicated

## Identity Theory (J.J.C. Smart, mid-20th century)
- **Core Thesis**: Mental states are identical to physical brain states
- **Key Concept**: Conscious experiences are nothing more than neurological processes
- **Implications**: Complete understanding of the brain would fully explain consciousness

## Panpsychism (Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Leibniz, historical; Thomas Nagel, David Chalmers, contemporary)
- **Core Thesis**: Consciousness is a fundamental feature of reality present in all things to some degree
- **Key Concept**: Even elementary particles possess some form of proto-consciousness
- **Implications**: Consciousness is not emergent but basic to the universe

## Emergentism (John Stuart Mill, 19th century; contemporary neuroscience)
- **Core Thesis**: Consciousness emerges from complex physical systems when they reach certain levels of organization
- **Key Concept**: Higher-level properties arise from but are not reducible to lower-level properties
- **Implications**: Consciousness requires physical complexity but has properties beyond those of its physical components

## Mysterianism (Colin McGinn, late 20th century)
- **Core Thesis**: The human mind is inherently incapable of understanding the nature of consciousness
- **Key Concept**: "Cognitive closure" - some problems are beyond human cognitive abilities to solve
- **Implications**: The hard problem of consciousness may be unsolvable for beings with our cognitive architecture

## Eliminative Materialism (Paul and Patricia Churchland, late 20th century)
- **Core Thesis**: Folk psychology and concepts like "consciousness" will eventually be eliminated by neuroscience
- **Key Concept**: Our intuitive understanding of mind is a radically false theory 
- **Implications**: Many philosophical problems about consciousness are based on conceptual confusions

## Eastern Philosophies (Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta)
- **Core Thesis**: The self is an illusion; consciousness is non-dual awareness
- **Key Concept**: Through meditation, one can realize consciousness is not confined to individual self
- **Implications**: Consciousness may be more fundamental than individual minds or selves
