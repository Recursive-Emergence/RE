# Actions for the MVP (Minimal Viable Product)

## 1. Empirical Anchors
- Identify datasets or simulations for each emergent layer:
  - **Chemical Layer**: 
    - Use RAF chemistry simulations based on Kauffman's model (see Appendix L)
    - Implement formose reaction simulation with autocatalytic tracking
    - Measure emergence potential in pre-LUCA chemical evolution
  - **Biological Layer**: Analyze RNA/DNA replication or metabolic scaling laws.
  - **Neural Layer**: Test spiking neural networks or Hebbian learning models.
  - **Cognitive Layer**: Use predictive processing models or interoceptive inference.
  - **Cultural Layer**: Study memetic evolution or institutional persistence.

## 2. Refine Persistence Threshold (Φ)
- Redefine Φ to include write-volume per time (ΔW).
- Simulate persistence thresholds across layers to validate the model.
- Test threshold behavior specifically in chemical-to-biological transition (Appendix L).

## 3. Prototype ACI Sandbox
- Build a sandbox agent with:
  - Online weight adaptation.
  - Explicit memory graph.
  - Recursive feedback loops.
- Test the agent's ability to demonstrate recursive emergence.
- Implement simplified chemical system simulations to validate framework fundamentals.

## 4. Mathematical Validation
- Provide worked examples for key equations:
  - Compute P(E) for ribosome, cortical micro-column, and Git's version-control graph.
  - Calculate emergence potential for RAF networks and formose reaction pathways.
- Validate mathematical archetypes (Fibonacci, Euler's number, elliptic curves) with empirical fits.

## 5. Comparative Analysis
- Create a short comparative table vs. competing theories:
  - Free Energy Principle.
  - Integrated Information Theory (IIT).
  - Global Workspace Theory.
  - Kauffman's Autocatalytic Sets Theory.

## 6. Falsifiable Predictions
- Define what would disprove the recursive-emergence claim:
  - Discovery of a large-scale structure accruing complexity without memory reuse.
  - Observation of life emerging without autocatalytic feedback mechanisms.

## 7. Visualization and Communication
- Enhance diagrams for clarity:
  - Add flowcharts or timelines for emergent layers.
  - Improve rendering quality of existing SVGs.
  - Create new visualization for RAF networks and chemical memory accumulation.

## 8. Literature Integration
- Reference key works to fortify transitions:
  - Stuart Kauffman's RAF theory for autocatalytic sets.
  - Anil Seth's interoceptive inference for selfhood.
  - Andy Clark's "Extended Mind" thesis for externalized cognition.
  - Wim Hordijk's work on autocatalytic set detection algorithms.
