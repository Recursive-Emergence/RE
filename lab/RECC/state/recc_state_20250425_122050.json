Their insights might highlight strengths or weaknesses you haven\u2019t considered.\n\n3. **Connect to Other Fields**: See if there are related theories or ideas in other disciplines. Cross-disciplinary insights can provide new angles and depth.\n\n4. **Empirical Testing**: Where possible, test your theories in practical settings. Data and observations can offer valuable reinforcement or suggest necessary adjustments.\n\n5. **Simulation and Modeling**: Use simulations to explore scenarios",
