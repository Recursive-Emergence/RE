But every day, Sprout absorbed sunlight, sipped water, and slowly stretched roots into the soil. \n\nWhile the older trees often shaded Sprout, they also protected it from strong winds and shared their wisdom through their gentle whispers in the breeze. Over time, Sprout learned the importance of patience and consistency.\n\nWith each passing season, Sprout grew taller and stronger, unnoticed by haste but marked by persistence. Eventually, it reached the height of a small tree, providing shade for villagers and a home for birds. \n\nSprout's journey showed that small, consistent efforts can lead",
