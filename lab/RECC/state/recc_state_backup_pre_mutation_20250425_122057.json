Over time, Sprout learned the importance of patience and consistency.\n\nWith each passing season, Sprout grew taller and stronger, unnoticed by haste but marked by persistence. Eventually, it reached the height of a small tree, providing shade for villagers and a home for birds. \n\nSprout's journey showed that small, consistent efforts can lead",
